# Recipe CRUD App

## Description

This is a Recipe CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built as my **Project 2** submission for the **General Assembly** Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp. The app allows users to share their recipes by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting them. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this project demonstrates full-stack development skills and RESTful API implementation learned during the bootcamp.

## .env Variables

Make sure to create a ```.env``` file in the root directory and set the following environment variables for the app to function correctly. Here is an example of what your ```.env``` file should look like:

```javascript
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<db_password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    DATABASE=<your-database-name>
    PASSWORD=<your-secure-password>
    SESSION_SECRET="<your-session-secret>"
```
